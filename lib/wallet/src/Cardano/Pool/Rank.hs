-- $RewardEpochs
--
-- NOTE [RewardEpochs]
--
-- We need to be careful to show the right information at the right time
-- in order prevent manipulation of the proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol.
--
-- In particular, we need to show those pool costs, margins, and owner stakes
-- that will affect the rewards for a delegation choice made at the present moment.
--
-- The reward cycle is illustrated in Section 11.2 of SL-D1, here a brief sketch.

--               ^
--           we are here
-- @
--
-- We imagine that we are in epoch /e1/, and choose to delegate to a pool.
-- At the end of epoch /e1/, a snapshot of the stake distribution will be taken.
-- This snapshot will be labeled "mark" during epoch /e2/, "set" during epoch /e3/,
-- and "go" during epoch /e4/.
-- Blocks will be produced randomly according to this stake distribution when
-- it is labeled "set", i.e. in epoch /e3/.
-- Rewards for this block production will be computed when this stake
-- distribution is labeled "go", i.e. during epoch /e4/, and these rewards will
-- paid out at the beginning of epoch /e5/.
--
-- The owner stake is part of the snapshot taken at the end of epoch /e1/.
-- If the pool is newly registered, its cost, margin and pledge are also
-- immediately available in epoch /e1/. However, if a pool re-registers,
-- the changes to its cost, margin and pledge will not be visible until the
-- next epoch; put differently, the rewards for the stake snapshot taken
-- at the end of epoch /e1/ will only depend on changes to cost, margin,
-- and pledge that the pool owner initiated in epoch /e0/.
-- This prevents pool owners from duping delegators by changing pool costs
-- during an epoch. However, the pool owner could still choose to undelegate
-- his stake, and fail to meet his pledge at the end of epoch /e1/,
-- which results in zero rewards paid out at the beginning of /e5/.
--
-- To summarize, in order to make an informed delegation choice
-- during epoch /e1/, the delegator needs to know 'RewardInfoPool' where
--
-- * 'stakeRelative', 'ownerStake', and 'ownerStakeRelative' are
--    taken at the time of decision (in epoch /e1/).
-- * 'ownerPledge', 'margin', 'cost' are the values of the last pool
--    registration certificate
--    from epoch /e0/ in case of an update,
--    or from epoch /e1/ in case of a newly created pool.
--
-- For the 'performanceEstimate', it's best to estimate it from recent pool
-- block production using functions provided here.
